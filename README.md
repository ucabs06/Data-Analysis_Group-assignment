Data Analysis on Yelp Dataset
Yelp is a website that allows users to share their reviews for businesses and services. Before making purchasing decisions, many consumers refer to reviews. Reviews sum up the collective wisdom of the public and give shape to the wealth of information. They are typically considered as important references for both launching a new business and ensuring its sustainability. The main objective of this project is to nudge an aspiring business owner in Arizona in the right direction by implementing data analysis for Yelp Dataset and answering the following research questions.
l Which businesses have been getting higher ratings in Arizona?
l Which businesses receive a lot of VIP Reviewer attention?
l Can business owners predict the ratings with specified features of the business?
l How different factors influence ratings for businesses in the state?
l Identify those VIP Reviewers, whose review are most influential, that can be invited to
review the new businesses.
The data used in this project is Yelp Dataset Round 8 and we mainly focused on three files, including business, reviews and users. Each file consists of one json-object-per-line. The business file determines business ID, name, state, stars and categories, etc. of every business. For each object in the review file, its business ID, user ID, stars, review text and date are specified. The user file is a user profile consists of personal details including name, friends, review_count, average_stars, etc.
